Stochastic Germination calculations

follows Johnston and Bassel, "Identification of a bet-hedging network motif generating noise in hormone concentrations and germination propensity in Arabidopsis.", Journal of the Royal Society Interface 15.141 (2018):20180042.

C code running (very) simple stochastic simulations for a chemical kinetic system; Mathematica notebook for corresponding analysis using the system size expansion; Gnuplot scripts for visualising these outputs (and producing figures for the above paper). Two small datafile provides related biological data for Fig 5.

For C code, compile with GCC and run from command line e.g.
gcc -o3 simulate-all.c -lm -o simulate-all.ce
./simulate-all.ce

------- Files

simulate-all.c -- C code using stochastic simulation to produce traces and summary statistics for time behaviour of several models in the text under different parameterisations. produces simulate-[parameters].txt and simulate-trace-[label]-[parameters].txt, respectively summaries and individual traces of these simulations used in Fig 2 and Fig 6 below.

stochastic-germination.nb -- Mathematica notebook applying the system size expansion to various models from the text to gather algebraic results and produce some figures (notable Fig 4B)
